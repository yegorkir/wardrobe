# 2026-01-11 — Shift win doc setup

## Goal
- Implement shift win policy in app-layer with ShiftService as SSOT and ShiftLog events.

## Notes
- Added ShiftWinPolicy and ShiftService hooks for total/served/active client counts.
- Shift win triggers ShiftLog `shift_won` and RunManager ends the shift via signal.
- Summary now includes end reasons derived from ShiftLog events.
- No non-obvious Godot 4.5 API behavior referenced.
