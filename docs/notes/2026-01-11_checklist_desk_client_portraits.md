# Checklist: Desk Client Portraits

- [x] Swap the desk client visual node to a TextureRect for portrait rendering.
- [x] Resolve client `portrait_key` into a texture in the desk UI adapter with fallback handling.
- [x] Keep patience bar updates wired to desk client visibility.
- [x] Run canonical tests.
- [x] Launch Godot once for runtime startup validation.
