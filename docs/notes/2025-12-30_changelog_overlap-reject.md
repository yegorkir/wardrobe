# Changelog: Overlap Reject + Push Budget

- Added overlap metrics collection (AABB overlap area ratio, per-item push estimate, total push, affected count) for shelf placement resolution.
- Implemented reject rules for large overlaps, including bounds checks and push budgets.
- Added small-overlap push handling with scaled impulse and planned-push logging.
- Added drop-to-floor handling on reject, including surface registry cleanup.
- Added debug logs for overlap metrics, decisions, and planned push distances.
- Renamed local variables to avoid GDScript shadowing warnings in the physics tick adapter.
- Added `drop_item_with_fall` in floor zones and routed overlap rejects to use real falling instead of snap.
- Adjusted stability bounds check to use center-of-mass over shelf bounds, keeping items stable when COG is still on the shelf.
- Updated shelf placement clamp and overlap-bound push checks to use COG-based bounds instead of visual half-width.
- Added mass-aware overlap pushing so heavier items receive smaller impulses and lighter items receive larger impulses.
- Added default mass mapping by `ItemType` when explicit `item_mass` is not provided.
- Adjusted shelf X clamping to account for COG offset to reduce edge snapping.
- Switched to one-sided overlap impulses so only the moved item gets an impulse; neighbors move via physical contact.
- Added per-item overlap cooldown to avoid repeated micro-push cycles.
- Added tiny-overlap ignore threshold to avoid resolving sub-pixel overlaps.
- Woke overlapping neighbor bodies before pushing to allow impulse chains (one item pushes another, then the next).
- Increased tiny-overlap ignore threshold to reduce residual rollback.
- Wake overlapping neighbors even during cooldown/tiny-overlap skips to improve chain motion.
- During overlap cooldown, still evaluate reject rules so big overlaps drop immediately instead of waiting.
- Removed neighbor overlap cooldown to restore springy motion while keeping self cooldown.
- Increased tiny-overlap ignore threshold to 1.0px to reduce residual rollback.
